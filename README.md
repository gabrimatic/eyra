An on-device agent for the terminal.

Eyra accepts voice or typed input, routes the request to the right model, and calls tools when needed. By default everything runs on your machine. No telemetry. Works with any OpenAI-compatible provider, local or remote.

---

## Quick Start

Requires an AI provider with an OpenAI-compatible API. Defaults to [Ollama](https://ollama.com) at `localhost:11434`. Point `API_BASE_URL` in `.env` at any other provider.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrimatic/eyra.git
cd eyra
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

Setup creates `.env`, installs dependencies, and verifies your backend and models. Then run:

```bash
uv run python src/main.py
```

Eyra runs preflight checks, then enters a live session:

```
Eyra

  Voice: on    Backend: ready

  Type anything or speak. /help for commands.
```

Eyra is now listening. Type or speak at any time.

---

## What it does

- Launches into an always-on agent session.
- Accepts typed or spoken input without leaving the session.
- Routes requests to the appropriate model. Complexity routing is available as an experimental option.
- Uses tools on demand via function calling: screenshot, time, weather, clipboard, system info, web browsing, filesystem.
- Speaks responses via local-whisper when available.
- Works with any OpenAI-compatible provider (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, OpenRouter, etc.).
- Image data is kept in memory; no disk I/O.

---

## How it works

Eyra runs as one live session with several concurrent subsystems:

- **Voice** is handled by [Local Whisper](https://github.com/gabrimatic/local-whisper) for both directions: input (ASR via Qwen3-ASR) and output (TTS via Kokoro). Eyra records the microphone via sounddevice and classifies each 32ms frame with Silero VAD. When the speaker pauses, the audio is transcribed through Local Whisper. Eyra will interrupt its own speech to hear you. Toggle with `/voice on|off`.
- **Typed input** is always available inline. Both channels feed the same conversation.
- **Complexity routing** is experimental and off by default. When enabled, requests are scored deterministically and dispatched to a Simple, Moderate, or Complex tier. When disabled, all requests use a single configured model.
- **Tool use** gives the model access to screenshot, time, weather, clipboard, and system info. Tools are defined as OpenAI function-calling schemas and executed locally. With complexity routing enabled, Simple/Moderate tiers receive lightweight tools and Complex receives all tools including screenshot.

### Preflight

On startup, Eyra validates:

- Backend reachability (tries `/v1/models`, falls back to Ollama `/api/tags`)
- Every configured model exists (auto-pulls via Ollama if needed)
- [Local Whisper](https://github.com/gabrimatic/local-whisper) for voice input and speech output (`brew tap gabrimatic/local-whisper && brew install local-whisper`)
- Screen capture (macOS built-in)

The session does not start until the backend and models are confirmed ready.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/voice on\|off` | Toggle voice input and speech output |
| `/mute` | Mute speech output only |
| `/unmute` | Unmute speech |
| `/goal <text>` | Set a conversational goal ("tell me when an error appears") |
| `/mode fast\|balanced\|best` | Set quality mode |
| `/status` | Show current runtime state |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation history |
| `/quit` | Exit |

Unknown commands are caught locally and never sent to the model.

---

## Quality Modes

Control the speed/quality trade-off with `/mode`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `fast` | Always use the smallest model |
| `balanced` | Let the router decide (default) |
| `best` | Always use the strongest model |

---

## Complexity Routing

Complexity routing is **experimental and off by default**. When disabled (`COMPLEXITY_ROUTING_ENABLED=false`), all requests use the single `MODEL` setting with all tools available.

When enabled (`COMPLEXITY_ROUTING_ENABLED=true`), every request in `balanced` mode is scored by `ComplexityScorer` before dispatch.

Scoring factors:

- Pattern matching for common prompt types
- Weighted signal scoring (reasoning cues, code/debug cues, domain terms)
- Prompt length and constraint analysis
- Follow-up context from recent messages

| Score | Model |
|-------|-------|
| Simple | `SIMPLE_MODEL` |
| Moderate | `MODERATE_MODEL` |
| Complex | `MODEL` |

All model names are set in `.env`. Any model supported by your provider works.

## Configuration

<details><summary><strong>.env reference</strong></summary>

```env
# Provider — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
API_KEY=ollama        # leave as-is for local; set your key for cloud providers

USE_MOCK_CLIENT=false

# Default model for all requests (used when complexity routing is off)
MODEL=qwen3.5:4b

# Tier models — only used when COMPLEXITY_ROUTING_ENABLED=true
SIMPLE_MODEL=qwen3.5:2b
MODERATE_MODEL=qwen3.5:4b

# Live runtime settings
AUTO_PULL_MODELS=true
LIVE_LISTENING_ENABLED=true
LIVE_SPEECH_ENABLED=true
SPEECH_COOLDOWN_MS=3000
VOICE_SILENCE_MS=1500          # silence after speech before processing (ms)
VOICE_VAD_THRESHOLD=0.6        # Silero VAD sensitivity (0.0-1.0, higher = stricter)

# Experimental: complexity-based routing. When disabled, all requests use MODEL.
COMPLEXITY_ROUTING_ENABLED=false
```

`API_BASE_URL` accepts any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Point it at Ollama (default), LM Studio, vLLM, OpenRouter, Groq, or OpenAI itself. `API_KEY` is ignored by local providers but required for cloud ones.

## Privacy

| Component | Where it runs |
|-----------|--------------|
| AI backend | `API_BASE_URL` (default: localhost:11434) |
| Silero VAD | ONNX model, in-process, local |
| Voice recording | sounddevice (PortAudio), in-process, local |
| wh transcribe (local-whisper) | Subprocess, local |
| wh whisper (local-whisper) | Subprocess, local |
| Screenshots | In-memory; never written to disk |

No telemetry. By default everything runs on your machine. If `API_BASE_URL` points at a remote provider, prompts and images will leave your machine to that provider.

## Troubleshooting

<details><summary><strong>AI backend not responding</strong></summary>

Check that your backend is running and reachable at the URL in `API_BASE_URL`. Eyra probes `/v1/models` on startup and reports the result.

For Ollama (default):

```bash
ollama list
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
```

If using a different provider, verify `API_BASE_URL` and `API_KEY` in `.env` are correct.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Voice not working</strong></summary>

Voice requires [Local Whisper](https://github.com/gabrimatic/local-whisper), which powers both input (ASR) and output (TTS). Install it:

```bash
brew tap gabrimatic/local-whisper && brew install local-whisper
```

Eyra's preflight automatically detects the installation (even if `wh` is not on PATH) and starts the service if needed. If preflight reports it's installed but not running, start manually with `wh start`.

You can also toggle voice at runtime with `/voice on|off`.
